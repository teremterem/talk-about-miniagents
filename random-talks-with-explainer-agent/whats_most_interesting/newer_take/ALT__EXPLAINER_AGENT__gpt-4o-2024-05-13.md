The core of the MiniAgents framework can be distilled into several key
components and concepts that work together to facilitate the creation of
LLM-based multi-agent systems. Here are the main elements that constitute the
core of the framework:

### 1. **MiniAgent and MiniAgents Context Manager**

- **`MiniAgent` Class**: This class wraps around an agent function or class,
  providing methods to initiate inquiries, send messages, and handle responses.
  It abstracts the complexity of managing asynchronous interactions between
  agents.
- **`MiniAgents` Context Manager**: This context manager sets up the environment
  for running agents, managing their lifecycle, and handling asynchronous tasks.
  It ensures that all tasks are completed before the context is exited.

### 2. **InteractionContext**

- **`InteractionContext` Class**: This class is passed to each agent function,
  providing access to incoming messages and allowing the agent to send replies.
  It manages the state and flow of messages within an agent's lifecycle.

### 3. **Message and MessagePromise**

- **`Message` Class**: Represents a message exchanged between agents. It is
  immutable and can contain text, metadata, and nested messages.
- **`MessagePromise` Class**: A promise of a message that can be streamed token
  by token. It allows for asynchronous resolution of messages, enabling token
  streaming and partial message processing.

### 4. **StreamedPromise and PromisingContext**

- **`StreamedPromise` Class**: Represents a promise of a whole value that can be
  streamed piece by piece. It allows for "replaying" the stream of pieces
  without involving the `streamer` function for the pieces that have already
  been produced.
- **`PromisingContext` Class**: Manages the context of promises, handling their
  lifecycle, and ensuring that all async tasks are completed before the context
  is exited.

### 5. **Agent Aggregators and Utilities**

- **Agent Aggregators**: These are pre-packaged agents that aggregate other
  agents into chains, loops, dialogs, etc. Examples
  include `agent_chain`, `agent_loop`, and `dialog_loop`.
- **Utilities**: Various utility functions and classes that support the core
  functionality, such as `MessageSequence`, `StreamAppender`,
  and `join_messages`.

### 6. **LLM Integrations**

- **LLMAgent Class**: A base class for agents that represent various Large
  Language Models (LLMs). It provides methods for preparing message
  dictionaries, producing tokens, and logging interactions.
- **Specific LLM Agents**: Implementations for specific LLM providers, such
  as `OpenAIAgent` and `AnthropicAgent`, which extend the `LLMAgent` class and
  integrate with their respective APIs.

### 7. **Extensibility and Customization**

- **Extensible Design**: The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing
  users to define custom agents, message types, and integrations with other LLM
  providers.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the behavior of agents, message
  handling, and logging through various configuration options and by subclassing
  core components.

### Summary

The core of the MiniAgents framework lies in its ability to manage asynchronous
interactions between agents using promises and streaming. The `MiniAgent`
and `MiniAgents` classes, along with the `InteractionContext`, `Message`,
and `StreamedPromise` classes, form the backbone of the framework. These
components work together to provide a flexible and extensible environment for
building LLM-based multi-agent systems.

========================================
Yes, there are several implicit signs of the functional programming paradigm in the MiniAgents framework. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Immutability**:
   - The `Frozen` class and its derivatives (`Message`, `MessagePromise`, etc.) emphasize immutability. Once created, these objects cannot be modified, which is a core principle of functional programming.

2. **First-Class Functions**:
   - Functions are treated as first-class citizens. The `@miniagent` decorator allows functions to be easily converted into agents, and functions are passed around as arguments (e.g., `PromiseResolver`, `PromiseStreamer`).

3. **Pure Functions**:
   - Many functions in the framework are designed to be pure, meaning they do not have side effects and their output depends only on their input. For example, the `Message` class's methods like `serialize` and `_as_string` are pure functions.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - The framework makes use of higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them. Examples include the `miniagent` decorator and the use of partial functions in the `Promise` and `StreamedPromise` classes.

5. **Declarative Style**:
   - The framework often uses a declarative style, where the focus is on what to do rather than how to do it. For example, the `miniagent` decorator declaratively defines an agent, and the `MessageSequence` class declaratively handles sequences of messages.

6. **Composition**:
   - The framework emphasizes composition over inheritance. Agents can be composed together using constructs like `agent_chain` and `agent_loop`, allowing for complex behaviors to be built from simpler components.

7. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - The use of promises (`Promise`, `StreamedPromise`, `MessagePromise`) introduces a form of lazy evaluation. Promises represent values that may not be available yet and are only computed when needed.

8. **Asynchronous Streams**:
   - The framework's emphasis on asynchronous streams (`StreamedPromise`, `MessageTokenAppender`) aligns with functional programming's focus on handling sequences of data in a functional manner.

9. **Event-Driven**:
   - The framework's design is event-driven, with handlers like `on_persist_message` and `on_promise_resolved` being registered to respond to specific events. This aligns with the functional programming paradigm's emphasis on reacting to events and changes in state.

10. **Statelessness**:
    - Many components in the framework are designed to be stateless, relying on the input provided to them rather than maintaining internal state. This is evident in the design of agents and the use of immutable messages.

Overall, while the MiniAgents framework is not purely functional, it incorporates many principles and practices from the functional programming paradigm, contributing to its robustness, modularity, and ease of reasoning about code.
