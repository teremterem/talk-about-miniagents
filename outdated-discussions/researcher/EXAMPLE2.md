What is the primary purpose of the `MiniAgents` framework, and what are the main use cases it aims to address?

can we please come back to this question later?

Sure, we can come back to that question later. What specific aspect of the framework would you like to understand better right now?

user
-------------------------------
No, it's your job to come up with questions. It is currently your role to ask questions about the framework, because you will be documenting it.

Understood. Let's dive into the details then. Here is my first question:

### Question 1:
The `MiniAgents` framework seems to heavily utilize promises and asynchronous operations. Can you explain the role of the `StreamedPromise` class and how it integrates with the rest of the framework? Specifically, how does it handle streaming pieces of data and packaging them into a whole?

-------------------------------
this framework revolves around the fact that LLM stream responses token by token, and I wanted all the agents to keep streaming those responses no matter how many miniagents an LLM response passes through

Got it, thank you for the clarification. Here's my next question:

### Question 2:
How does the `MiniAgents` framework ensure that the token-by-token streaming of responses from the LLM is maintained across multiple miniagents? Are there specific mechanisms or design patterns in place to facilitate this continuous streaming?

user
-------------------------------
All the agents communicate with each other using MessageSequencePromise, which can be thought of as a promise of promises

Thank you for the information. Here's my next question:

### Question 3:
Can you elaborate on how the `MessageSequencePromise` works? Specifically, how does it manage the sequence of promises and ensure that each miniagent can process and stream the tokens in a continuous manner?
