`MessageSequencePromise` is a specialized type of `StreamedPromise` that deals with a sequence of `MessagePromise` objects. Here's a breakdown of how it works and ensures continuous streaming:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `MessageSequencePromise` is initialized with a producer function that yields `MessagePromise` objects. This producer function can be an `AppendProducer` or any other async iterator.

2. **Streaming Messages**:
   - The `MessageSequencePromise` class inherits from `StreamedPromise`, which means it can stream pieces of data (in this case, `MessagePromise` objects) one by one.
   - As each `MessagePromise` is produced, it is yielded to the consumer. This allows the consumer to start processing the first message while the subsequent messages are still being produced.

3. **Flattening**:
   - The `MessageSequence` class, which is used to create `MessageSequencePromise`, has a `flattener` function. This function takes an input (which can be a nested structure of messages) and flattens it into a sequence of `MessagePromise` objects.
   - The `flattener` ensures that any nested sequences or collections of messages are properly flattened into a single sequence of `MessagePromise` objects.

4. **Continuous Streaming**:
   - Each `MessagePromise` itself is a `StreamedPromise` that streams tokens of a message. When a `MessagePromise` is yielded by the `MessageSequencePromise`, the consumer can start iterating over the tokens of that message immediately.
   - This design allows for continuous streaming of tokens across multiple miniagents. As soon as a `MessagePromise` is available, the consumer can start processing its tokens while the next `MessagePromise` is being prepared.

5. **Collection and Packaging**:
   - The `MessageSequencePromise` can be collected into a tuple of `Message` objects using the `acollect_messages` method. This method iterates over all the `MessagePromise` objects, collects their tokens, and packages them into `Message` objects.
   - The `packager` function in `StreamedPromise` is responsible for packaging the whole sequence into a final result (a tuple of `Message` objects in this case).

By using `MessageSequencePromise`, the `MiniAgents` framework ensures that the token-by-token streaming of responses is maintained across multiple miniagents. Each miniagent can process and stream tokens as soon as they are available, allowing for efficient and continuous streaming of data.

I also know that the act of "flattening" does not happen on the spot, rather it is scheduled (for immediate execution or otherwise). What does it mean?

gpt-4o-2024-05-13
-------------------------------
In the context of the `MiniAgents` framework, "flattening" refers to the process of converting a nested or hierarchical structure of messages into a flat sequence of `MessagePromise` objects. The act of flattening being "scheduled" means that this process is not performed immediately when the `MessageSequence` is created. Instead, it is deferred and executed asynchronously, either immediately or at a later time, depending on the configuration.

Here's a more detailed explanation of what it means for flattening to be scheduled:

### Immediate vs. Deferred Execution

1. **Immediate Execution**:
   - When flattening is scheduled for immediate execution, the framework will start the flattening process as soon as the `MessageSequence` is created. This means that the nested structure will be traversed, and `MessagePromise` objects will be produced and made available to the consumer right away.
   - This is useful when you want to start processing the messages as soon as possible without any delay.

2. **Deferred Execution**:
   - When flattening is scheduled for deferred execution, the framework will delay the flattening process until it is explicitly triggered. This can happen when the consumer starts iterating over the `MessageSequencePromise` or when a specific method (like `acollect_messages`) is called.
   - This approach can be beneficial when you want to control the timing of the flattening process, for example, to optimize resource usage or to coordinate with other asynchronous operations.

### How Scheduling Works

- **PromisingContext**:
  - The `PromisingContext` class manages the scheduling of tasks within the framework. It keeps track of whether tasks should be scheduled immediately or deferred based on the context configuration.
  - When a `MessageSequence` is created, it checks the `schedule_immediately` flag to determine whether to start the flattening process right away or to defer it.

- **StreamedPromise**:
  - The `StreamedPromise` class, which `MessageSequencePromise` inherits from, handles the streaming of pieces (tokens) and the packaging of the whole (complete message).
  - The `producer` function in `StreamedPromise` is responsible for generating the pieces. When flattening is scheduled, this producer function is either invoked immediately or deferred until the consumer starts iterating over the promise.

### Benefits of Scheduled Flattening

- **Efficiency**:
  - By deferring the flattening process, the framework can avoid unnecessary computations and resource usage until it is actually needed. This can lead to more efficient use of system resources.

- **Flexibility**:
  - Scheduled flattening provides flexibility in managing asynchronous operations. It allows the framework to coordinate the timing of different tasks, ensuring that they are executed in the most optimal order.

- **Parallelism**:
  - Immediate scheduling can enable parallel processing of messages, as the flattening process starts right away and messages can be processed concurrently. Deferred scheduling, on the other hand, allows for more controlled and sequential processing.

In summary, the act of flattening being scheduled means that the process of converting a nested structure into a flat sequence of `MessagePromise` objects is managed asynchronously. It can be executed immediately or deferred based on the configuration, providing efficiency, flexibility, and the ability to handle parallelism in the `MiniAgents` framework.

-------------------------------
But still, what does "immediate execution" means? When I create a MessageSequence object there is no await, it's a synchronous operation. But the act of flattening is an asynchronous process, because it also involves resolving other promises (because async sequences can be nested in other async sequences)

gpt-4o-2024-05-13
-------------------------------
You're correct. The creation of a `MessageSequence` object is a synchronous operation, but the actual process of flattening the sequence is asynchronous. When we talk about "immediate execution" in this context, it means that the asynchronous task responsible for flattening the sequence is scheduled to start as soon as possible, without waiting for an explicit trigger from the consumer.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Immediate Execution

When we say that flattening is scheduled for immediate execution, it means that the framework will create and schedule an asynchronous task to start the flattening process right away. This task will run in the background, and it will begin resolving nested promises and producing `MessagePromise` objects as soon as the `MessageSequence` is created.

### How Immediate Execution Works

1. **Task Scheduling**:
   - When a `MessageSequence` is created with `schedule_immediately=True`, the framework schedules an asynchronous task to start the flattening process. This is done using the `PromisingContext` class, which manages the scheduling of tasks.
   - The task is created using `asyncio.create_task` or a similar mechanism, and it is added to the event loop for immediate execution.

2. **Asynchronous Flattening**:
   - The flattening process itself is asynchronous because it involves resolving nested promises, which may require awaiting other asynchronous operations.
   - The `producer` function in the `StreamedPromise` class is responsible for generating the pieces (in this case, `MessagePromise` objects). When the task is scheduled, this producer function starts running asynchronously, traversing the nested structure and yielding `MessagePromise` objects.

3. **Consumer Interaction**:
   - Even though the flattening process starts immediately, the consumer does not need to await the creation of the `MessageSequence` object. The consumer can start iterating over the `MessageSequencePromise` whenever they are ready.
   - As the consumer iterates over the `MessageSequencePromise`, they will receive `MessagePromise` objects that have already been produced by the background task. If the consumer starts iterating before the task has finished, they will receive the promises as they are produced.

### Example

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept:

```python
async def flattener(_, item):
    if isinstance(item, list):
        for sub_item in item:
            yield sub_item
    else:
        yield item

async def main():
    async with PromisingContext():
        message_sequence = MessageSequence(
            producer_capture_errors=True,
            schedule_immediately=True,  # Immediate execution
        )
        with message_sequence.append_producer:
            message_sequence.append_producer.append(["msg1", "msg2"])
            message_sequence.append_producer.append("msg3")

        # The flattening process starts immediately in the background
        async for message_promise in message_sequence.sequence_promise:
            message = await message_promise
            print(message)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example:
- The `MessageSequence` is created with `schedule_immediately=True`, so the flattening process starts immediately in the background.
- The consumer starts iterating over the `MessageSequencePromise` and receives `MessagePromise` objects as they are produced by the background task.
- The flattening process is asynchronous and involves resolving nested promises, but the consumer does not need to await the creation of the `MessageSequence` object.

### Summary

"Immediate execution" means that the asynchronous task responsible for flattening the sequence is scheduled to start as soon as possible, running in the background. The consumer can start iterating over the `MessageSequencePromise` whenever they are ready, and they will receive `MessagePromise` objects as they are produced by the background task. This allows for efficient and continuous streaming of data, even though the creation of the `MessageSequence` object itself is a synchronous operation.
