The `MessageSequencePromise` is a specialized type of `StreamedPromise` that handles a sequence of messages, where each message itself can be a promise. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

### Key Components:
1. **StreamedPromise**: The base class that handles streaming pieces of data and packaging them into a whole.
2. **MessagePromise**: A promise of a single message that can be streamed token by token.
3. **MessageSequencePromise**: A promise of a sequence of messages, where each message can be streamed.

### How `MessageSequencePromise` Works:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `MessageSequencePromise` is initialized with a producer function that yields `MessagePromise` objects.
   - It also has a packager function that collects all the messages into a tuple.

2. **Streaming Messages**:
   - The producer function of `MessageSequencePromise` yields `MessagePromise` objects one by one.
   - Each `MessagePromise` can be iterated over to get tokens (pieces of the message) in a streaming fashion.

3. **Flattening Messages**:
   - The `MessageSequence` class, which `MessageSequencePromise` relies on, has a flattener function that converts nested structures of messages into a flat sequence of `MessagePromise` objects.
   - This ensures that even if messages are nested or come from different sources, they are flattened into a single sequence that can be processed continuously.

4. **Continuous Streaming**:
   - As each `MessagePromise` is yielded by the producer, it can be consumed token by token.
   - This allows each miniagent to process tokens as they arrive, maintaining the continuous streaming of responses.

### Example Flow:
1. **Agent A** sends a request to an LLM and receives a `MessageSequencePromise`.
2. **Agent B** processes the `MessageSequencePromise` by iterating over it, receiving `MessagePromise` objects.
3. For each `MessagePromise`, **Agent B** iterates over the tokens, processing them as they arrive.
4. **Agent B** can then send its own `MessageSequencePromise` to the next agent, continuing the streaming process.

### Code Snippet:
Here's a simplified example to illustrate the flow:

```python
async def agent_a():
    # Simulate sending a request to an LLM and receiving a MessageSequencePromise
    message_sequence = MessageSequencePromise(producer=llm_producer, packager=llm_packager)
    return message_sequence

async def agent_b(message_sequence):
    async for message_promise in message_sequence:
        async for token in message_promise:
            process_token(token)
        process_message(await message_promise)

async def main():
    message_sequence = await agent_a()
    await agent_b(message_sequence)

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, `agent_a` sends a request and receives a `MessageSequencePromise`. `agent_b` processes the sequence by iterating over each `MessagePromise` and then over each token within the message, ensuring continuous streaming.

This design allows the `MiniAgents` framework to maintain token-by-token streaming across multiple miniagents, facilitating efficient and responsive processing of LLM responses.
