In the `miniagents/miniagents.py` file, the `MiniAgent` class has a method called `inquire`. Could you explain the purpose of the `schedule_immediately` parameter in the `inquire` method and how it affects the behavior of the agent?

-------------------------------
The `schedule_immediately` parameter in the `inquire` method of the `MiniAgent` class determines whether the agent's function should be scheduled for execution immediately or not. 

Here's how it affects the behavior of the agent:

- **If `schedule_immediately` is `True` or `DEFAULT` (which defaults to `True` in `MiniAgents`):**
  - The agent's function is scheduled for execution immediately. This means that the function will start running as soon as possible, without waiting for any explicit trigger.

- **If `schedule_immediately` is `False`:**
  - The agent's function is not scheduled for execution immediately. Instead, it will only be executed when its result is explicitly awaited. This allows for more control over when the agent's function is run, which can be useful in scenarios where you want to manage the timing of agent executions manually.

In summary, the `schedule_immediately` parameter controls whether the agent's function is executed right away or deferred until explicitly triggered.
