Here's an updated docstring for the `MiniAgent` class:

```python
class MiniAgent:
    """
    A class representing a mini-agent that can process and respond to messages.

    The MiniAgent class provides a flexible and extensible way to define agents
    that can engage in conversational interactions. It allows for the creation
    of agents with custom processing logic and the ability to handle various
    types of messages.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the agent.
        process_func (Callable): The function that defines the agent's processing logic.
        verbose (bool): Indicates whether the agent should log verbose output.
        inquire_func (Optional[Callable]): The function used for inquiring with the agent.

    Methods:
        inquire(messages: Iterable[Message], schedule_immediately: bool = True) -> MessagePromise:
            Sends a sequence of messages to the agent for processing and returns a promise
            representing the agent's response.

        process(messages: Iterable[Message]) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
            Processes a sequence of messages and yields the agent's response as a stream of tokens.

    Example:
        >>> def my_process_func(messages: Iterable[Message]) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        ...     # Define the agent's processing logic here
        ...     yield "Hello, how can I assist you today?"
        ...
        >>> agent = MiniAgent("MyAgent", my_process_func)
        >>> response = await agent.inquire([Message(role="user", content="Hi there!")])
        >>> print(response.content)
        Hello, how can I assist you today?
    """
    # Rest of the class code...
```

This updated docstring provides a more comprehensive description of the `MiniAgent` class, including its purpose, attributes, methods, and an example of how to use it. It explains that the class represents a mini-agent that can process and respond to messages, and it highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the class for defining agents with custom processing logic.
