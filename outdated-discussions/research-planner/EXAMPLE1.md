Certainly! To understand the framework better and prepare for documenting it, I'll need to ask a series of detailed questions. Here's a structured plan for the questions:

### General Overview
1. **Purpose and Scope**
   - What is the primary purpose of the MiniAgents framework?
   - What are the main use cases for this framework?

2. **Core Concepts**
   - Can you explain the core concepts of the framework, such as "agents", "messages", and "promises"?

### Detailed Components
3. **Agents**
   - What is the role of an agent in this framework?
   - How do you create and use an agent?
   - What are the key methods and properties of the `MiniAgent` class?

4. **Messages**
   - What is the structure of a `Message`?
   - How are messages used within the framework?
   - What is the purpose of `MessagePromise` and `MessageSequencePromise`?

5. **Promises**
   - What is a `StreamedPromise` and how does it differ from a regular promise?
   - How do `AppendProducer` and `StreamedPromise` interact?
   - What are the key methods and properties of the `StreamedPromise` class?

6. **Contexts and Events**
   - What is the `PromisingContext` and how is it used?
   - What are the different event handlers available in the framework (e.g., `on_promise_collected`, `on_node_collected`)?

### Extensions and Integrations
7. **LLM Integrations**
   - How does the framework integrate with language models like OpenAI and Anthropic?
   - What are the key methods and properties of the `create_openai_agent` and `create_anthropic_agent` functions?

### Utilities and Helpers
8. **Utility Functions**
   - What are the key utility functions provided by the framework (e.g., `achain_loop`, `join_messages`, `split_messages`)?
   - How are these utility functions typically used?

### Testing and Examples
9. **Testing**
   - What is the testing strategy for the framework?
   - Are there any specific testing utilities or patterns used in the framework?

10. **Examples**
    - Can you provide a detailed walkthrough of the example provided in `examples/llm_example.py`?
    - Are there any other examples or use cases that would be helpful to understand the framework better?

### Future Enhancements
11. **Planned Features**
    - Are there any planned features or enhancements for the framework?
    - How do you envision the framework evolving in the future?

### Documentation and Best Practices
12. **Documentation**
    - What are the key points that should be covered in the documentation?
    - Are there any best practices or guidelines for using the framework effectively?

### Specific Questions
13. **Specific Code Questions**
    - What is the purpose of the `InteractionContext` class?
    - How does the `miniagent` decorator work internally?
    - What is the role of the `Node` class and its subclasses?

By asking these questions, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the MiniAgents framework, which will help in creating detailed and accurate documentation.
